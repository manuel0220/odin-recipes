# odin-recipes

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Manuel Ayala, a passionate frontend developer from El Salvador, Iâ€™m currently working on the odin project, Iâ€™m currently learning HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT.

This is a webpage for 3 recipes about favorites food, in this project I put in practice what i learned about html, their tags, semantic html and how to link one html page to another, in addition to this I decided to add a little bit of css to have this page more fan, I support myself most of the time in the official documentation.

I made this project to learn semantic html5, a little bit of css and learn how they interact each other.
